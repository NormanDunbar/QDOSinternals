To contact QDOS and SMSQ/E Internals, simply ask on the [QL Forum](https://qlforum.co.uk), the [QL Wiki](https://qlwiki.qlforum.co.uk) or contact me, personally, by clicking one of the "social" media site icons scattered around this, and every other, page! (They *should* be down below, to the right.)

I'll do my utmost to get back to you asap.

Thanks,   
Norm.
