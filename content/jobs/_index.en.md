Jobs are what allows the QL to appear to run multiple processes at once. It is an illusion of course, as only one process can be executing at any one time, however, thanks to the magic of time slicing, we get the impression that we have lots of processes running. These processes are our jobs. Jobs are often referred to as tasks, but the two terms are interchangeable. Pick whichever one you like best!
