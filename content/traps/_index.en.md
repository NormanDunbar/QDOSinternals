There are a number of traps available on the MC68000 series of processors, however, under QDOS and SMSQ/E, we have access to only 5 of those. These are:

* [Trap #0: Supervisor mode](/traps/trap_0/).
* [Trap #1: Manager traps](/traps/trap_1/trap_1).
* [Trap #2: Input/Output Management traps](/traps/trap_2/trap_2/).
* [Trap #3: Input/Output traps](/traps/trap_3/trap_3/).
* [Trap #4: SuperBASIC absolute addressing trap](/traps/trap_4/).
