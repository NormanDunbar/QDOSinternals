# QDOSMSQ - The new home of QDOS Internals.

## Introduction

Welcome to **QDOSMSQ.Dunbar-it.co.uk** the new home of the web site
formerly known as **QDOS Internals**.

This website intends to be the definitive on-line location for all known
information about the internal workings of the QDOS and SMSQ/E operating
systems for the good old Sinclair QL Computer and derivatives.

The site is able to be read by *anyone* but only updated by
[*registered users*](#registering_for_write_access).


## Assembly Language Mailing List {#assembly_language_mailing_list}

With the demise of the last surviving QL magazine in print form, *QL
Today*, my series on Assembly Language came to an abrupt end. I still
dabble in Assembly Language and some of my faithful readers might wish
to keep up to date with my various ramblings on the matter. If so,
please subscribe to my mailing list so that you can be kept up to date
as and when I create new articles. I have to say though, I\'m pretty
intermittent in getting stuff ready to \"print\", so there is no fixed
schedule for when the next issue will be made available.

I also had plans to combine everything done so far over the years into a
\"book\" and make that available for download too. That work has been
completed and the latest copy can always be downloaded from
<https://github.com/NormanDunbar/QLAssemblyLanguageBook/releases/latest>.
Enjoy.

You can subscribe to the mailing list at
[<http://qdosmsq.dunbar-it.co.uk/mailinglist>](http://qdosmsq.dunbar-it.co.uk/mailinglist).

Please note, that I ask for your name as part of the subscription
process, this is to try and stop spam bots from subscribing. I get a lot
of those. **I do not use your information for any other purpose than
sending out notifications about the eMagazine.**


## Registering for Write Access {#registering_for_write_access}

If you are reading this online, then I have converted my Wiki to a static Web Site using the excellent, 
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
site builder. I write (or convert) my pages to Markdown and Hugo converts them to HTML and CSS. There is, unfortunately,
no more write access.

However, if I have got my act together, and put all this onto a github repository, then anyone raising a pull request or
sending me an issue notification, will effectively have write access. Whenever I push a commit to the repository, the web
site is rebuilt on te fly, well, the changes are anyway.


## Quick Links {#quick_links}

To save you hunting down the links to the actual content of the site,
I\'m putting them here at the top where it is easy to find.

* [QDOS/SMSQ topics](qdosmsq/index).
* [Linux topics](linux/index).
* [Assembly Language mailing List](http://qdosmsq.dunbar-it.co.uk/mailinglist) Sign up, or unsubscribe, for a newsletter on Assembly Language programming - continuing from where the QL Today magazine left off.


And finally, charitable stuff you may be interested in taking a quick
look at and possibly helping people less well off that we are. Or
indeed, chickens!

## My Book {#my_book}


![My Book's cover, Arduino Software Internals](qdosmsq/arduinosoftwareinternals.cover.jpg "Arduino Software Internals by Norman Dunbar")

In April 2020, after over two years in the making, my first book was
published by APress. Ardiuino Software Internals explains all about the
Arduino Software, and \"language\" and how it works. Also, the book
connects the software to the hardware by showing you how the hardware
works.

You can find it on the 
[Apress web site](https://www.apress.com/gb/book/9781484257890), 
on 
[Amazon (UK)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Arduino-Software-Internals-Complete-Language/dp/1484257898)
or on 
[Amazon (USA)](https://www.amazon.com/Arduino-Software-Internals-Complete-Language/dp/1484257898).
Usually Apress (aka Springer) has a better price and free world wide
postage. Amazon may have a cheaper price from time to time, but if it
gets below £20.00, they will charge you for postage.

The book is 600 pages plus the index. I think it\'s an excellent book,
but don\'t take my word for it, there\'s a review, by Ralph S Bacon, over on 
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF2v47PNCDU&t=505s). Have a listen,
then make your own mind up.

If you buy, or have already bought, a copy, *thank you very much*.

If you didn\'t, or haven\'t bought a copy \-- why not? :-(

If you can\'t make up your mind, try Amazon\'s \"look inside\" option
and grab a preview; or, alternatively\...

Look for the Kindle version on Amazon and download a free preview.

If you are interested, this is the blurb on the back cover:

*It's not enough to just build your Arduino projects; it's time to
actually learn how things work! This book will take you through not only
how to use the Arduino software and hardware, but more importantly show
you how it all works and how the software relates to the hardware.*

*Arduino Software Internals takes a detailed dive into the Arduino
environment. We'll cover the Arduino language, hardware features, and
how makers can finally ease themselves away from the hand holding of the
Arduino environment and move towards coding in plain AVR C++ and talk to
the microcontroller in its native language.*

*What You'll Learn:*

* *How the Arduino Language interfaces with the hardware, as well as how it actually works in C++;*
* *How the compilation system works, and how kit can be altered to suit personal requirements;*
* *A small amount of AVR Assembly Language;*
* *Exactly how to set up and use the various hardware features of the AVR without needing to try and 
decode the data sheets – which are often bug ridden and unclear;*
* *Alternatives to the Arduino IDE which might give them a better workflow;*
* *How to build their own Arduino clone from scratch.*`

*Who This Book Is For:*

*No expertise is required for this book! All you need is an interest in
learning about what you're making with Arduinos and how they work. This
book is also useful for those looking to understand the AVR
microcontroller used in the Arduino boards. In other words, all Makers
are welcome!*


## The Other QL Wiki {#the_other_ql_wiki}

This is not the only QL Wiki in the entire world. Rich Mellor has one
with lots of information on the QL in general, some of the characters
and software available - past and present. The link is
[<https://qlwiki.qlforum.co.uk>](https://qlwiki.qlforum.co.uk/).
Check it out, and *why not contribute a page or two?*


## Thanks George {#thanks_george}

I started a web site many years ago. It was called QDOS Internals and on
it I started to document everything I knew or could find out about the
inner workings of QDOS. That web site underwent long periods of not much
happening at all as work and \'life\' took up most of my waking hours.

I converted the web site to a Wiki - you are reading it now - and opened
it up to all and sundry after I had converted a fair amount of the old
HTML pages to the text format used by the Wiki.

However, one of my registered users has excelled at writing
documentation and has filled many pages on this Wiki. That user is
**George Gwilt** and I would like to publicly thank him for helping
out with the documentation.

Hopefully more users will add to the site and indeed, I hope to get time
to add a lot more myself as well. I don\'t intend to leave everything to
George to write for me!

Thanks.

## Read my blog {#read_my_blog}

I have a blog now - like most of the rest of the on-line world. You can
join in the fun [by clicking
here](http://qdosmsq.dunbar-it.co.uk/blog) if you wish to.

It is not QDOSMSQ specific, you\'ll find lots of stuff there eventually.
Some of it wholesome, some of it offensive. I can rant on almost any
subject for quite some time when the mood takes me. Sometimes I\'m even
right!

### Linux Musings and Ramblings {#linux_musings_and_ramblings}

I quite like Linux, I certainly prefer it to Windows that\'s for sure.
To this end and *especially* after Windows ate my Linux root partition
just after Christmas 2007, I decided that my Laptop would be totally
Linux - and so it is. It is now running [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/) and in my opinion, this is
the finest version of Linux yet, especially for any first time converts
from Windows.

The one program I did use under Windows,
[QPC2](https://www.kilgus.net/qpc/), runs perfectly
under Linux with Wine, however, it cannot access QDOS floppy discs
natively - not a problem for me these days as all my old QL floppies
died a horrible death in storage. Under Windows it uses direct sector
access (I\'m told this by Marcel) which is not going to work on Linux
under Wine. What to do? The sole survivors of my floppy collection have
been \"ripped\" to image files on Linux using the *dd* command, and QPC
is able to read those images as if they were floppy drives.

but hey, these are the ramblings of a mad man! LOL
